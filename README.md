Gankmaku
=========
 
 Project created for learning how to apply the **Android-CleanArchitecture** with [Reactive Programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) and Android good practices to develop a **MVP (Model View Presenter)** application using [gank.io/api](http://gank.io/api) as the domain of the application.
 
Motivation
----
After studied these two projects:

- [Android-CleanArchitecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture)
- [Mosby](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby)

I decided to make my own implenentation using these two projects as reference.
